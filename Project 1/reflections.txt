Question 1:

I went into this course with a decent amount of programming experience\n
and therefore thus far I have not come across anything that I did not\n
know how to do. I have not used the strikethrough tags in quite some\n
time so I did have to refresh myself.

Question 2: 

The easiest part of the experience for me so far has been the receiving\n
of instruction. The content is presented in a way that is quite easy to\n
understand and the directions are easy to follow.

Question 3:

The most difficult part of the experience so far has been not wanting to\n
stop working. The experience is so fun and rewarding that I find myself\n
unable to log off.

Question 4: 

I have used the problem solving strategies that were outlined to refresh myself\n
which HTML tags are necessary in which situations(e.g. <p> tags have margins but\n
<span> tags do not).
